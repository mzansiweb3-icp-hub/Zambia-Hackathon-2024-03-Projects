Welcome to Zambia's Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Hackathon! This event is dedicated to exploring the possibilities of the Internet Computer using Motoko. Here, you will find all the resources you need to get started, learn, and create innovative projects.

## About the Hackathon

This hackathon is an exciting opportunity for students to dive into the world of decentralized applications using the Internet Computer Protocol. It's a great chance to collaborate, innovate, and develop your skills in Motoko and blockchain technology.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js
- CDK
- Git

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the hackathon, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. [Node.js Official Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- **Git**: A distributed version control system to track changes in source code during software development. [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
